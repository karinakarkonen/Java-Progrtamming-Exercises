# Matrix Digit Checker

A Java application that validates if every row and column in a 10x10 matrix contains at least one single-digit number (0-9).

## Features
- **Row & Column Validation:** Checks each axis for the presence of single-digit integers.
- **Optimized Logic:** Uses nested loops with `break` statements for efficient processing.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java
- **Core Concepts:** 2D Arrays, Boolean Flags, Flow Control.

## Learnings
- Improved algorithmic efficiency by implementing early exit strategies.
- Mastered 2D array traversal and multi-condition validation.
